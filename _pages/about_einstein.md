I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [North Carolina State University Department of Computer Science](https://csc.ncsu.edu/), Raleigh. I am working under the guidance of [Dr. Jung-Eun Kim](https://jungeunkim.wordpress.ncsu.edu). I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at NC State in Spring 2025. Prior to that, I graduated with a B.Tech. in Electronics & Communications Engineering (ECE) from [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. [Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in).

My research is driven by a deep interest in the **dynamics of memorization and generalization in deep learning systems**. Specifically, I study how models encode these phenomena, why certain features tend to be memorized while others generalize, and how to design architectures or training methods that promote generalization while mitigating memorization.

Beyond this core focus, my broader research interests include **explainability and interpretability in AI**, addressing **spurious correlations** and **invariances**, and developing approaches that enhance the **efficiency, robustness, safety, and privacy** of large-scale foundation models.  My long-term goal is to contribute toward building **trustworthy AI systems** that balance strong generalization performance with **privacy safety** and **computational efficiency**.
